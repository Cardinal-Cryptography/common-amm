# Notes

This directory contains e2e tests for Farm contract, written using `drink!` and `ink-wrapper` integration. Currently, this integration lives in a feature branch of `ink-wrapper` repository and its future is not set in stone. It does however allow for writing e2e-styled unit tests for contracts using statically-typed API generated by the `ink-wrapper`. 

In `Makefile` of the `farm` directory you will find calls to `ink-wrapper` but it assumes that you're using `ink-wrapper` installed from a specific git hash:
```
cargo install --git https://github.com/Cardinal-Cryptography/ink-wrapper --rev 28bce20d63ff174a437b89c7e9becc78cd4dbd52 ink-wrapper
```

We do not guarantee it will work with other versions.
